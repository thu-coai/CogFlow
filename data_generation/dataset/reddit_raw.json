        "Title": "AITA for telling my wife the lock on my daughter's door does not get removed til my brother inlaw and his daughters are out of our house?",
        "Post Text": "My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.\nHis sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\n\nOlivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. \n\nLast straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.\nI told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\n\nSammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.\nSammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.\nHe accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\n\nI told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\n\nShe got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\n\nEveryone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.",

            "NTA. Don't back down. You are the only one sticking up for Zoey. If her cousins want to use expensive makeup, give them your wife's. I guarantee she won't appreciate sharing anymore.\n\nThey need to start behaving like appreciative guests.",
            "NTA\n\nYour daughter doesn’t feel like she has any privacy or respect in her own home and you gave her a lock to give her back her privacy. You tried talking to your wife, your BiL and your nieces and that got you nowhere - if your daughter has to accept 3 additional adults living in her home, they need to accept her very reasonable boundaries of not taking and ruining her things. \n\nGood for you showing your daughter you respect and support her.",
            "NTA\n\n>my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\"\n\nHis daughthers are in fact thieves because there's a thin line in between stealing and borrowing and that is our bestie CONSENT.\n\nHis daughters don't ask yours for permission on whether they can take something from her or not. They help themselves into her room, into her cabinets/closet, take whatever they feel entilted to, use it however they want even if they drestroy it and then IF SO your daughter might see the object they stole from her again.\n\nYou are being an amazing parent and Zoey will forever be grateful for having her back the way a parent should. Whereas, your wife... I don't know if it's the fact that those are her brother's daughters or if she just doesn't care about people getting through her daguther at whatever cost just to steal her property and damage it.\n\n^(Also, funny how it went from \"my daughters aren't thieves\" to \"my daughters just wanted to spend time with yours and now they aren't allowed to do so :(\".)",
            "\"I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do\"\n\nI think you need to think ahead with this situation. You are your daughter are already uncomfortable in your own home. Your wife is upset. You need to do what is right for your immediate family before it puts even more strain on your relationship.\n\nI think you need to get them to leave before it gets worse. It doesnt take much imagination to see how it could.\n\nHow uncomfortable do you have to be in your own home before something snaps? This is not a tenable situation. You have a right to feel safe /comfortable in your own home and anyone that militates against that is playing a dangerous game.",
            "NTA. \nNormal behaviour is asking to borrow stuff and respecting a persons decision if they say no.\nYou don't walk into other people's rooms without permission, 'borrowing' without asking is Stealing. \n\nAnd good on you for standing by your daughter. She needs her privacy and also needs a sense of ownership, her belongings are hers and those girls don't respect that.",
            "NTA.\n\nGood for you for standing up for your daughter. The lock should stay. There would be no need for it except that the girls are thieves.\n\nThe adult girls should pay your daughter back for the makeup. She saved for it. They stole it. \n\n\nTime for the rest of the family to take a turn at helping BIL out.",
            "NTA. And why the heck are you supposed to treat them like daughters? They have their dad with them.",
            "NTA. As someone who had a “family friend” move into our house “temporarily” when I was in middle school. You did the right thing. The “family friend” who moved in with us, was only supposed to be there temporarily, until he got himself an apartment. Lived with us for 4 years. He only moved out because my parents eventually separated and divorced, while he was still living with us. So for the last 4 years that my family, was a family, we had some guy, who my sister and I didnt even like, live in our home. \n\nDo yourself and your family a favour and give a timeline that they have to move out by or you will be taken advantage of and it might ruin your marriage.",
            "NTA\n\nSammy sounds like he is spoiling his daughters and justifying their actions by blaming the victim (Zoey). Kicking them out may be a good idea at this point."

That’s when I started getting voice messages from her saying she will never see me again. She would go on these tantrums breaking dishes and such. Eventually she just never came out of bed and my dad had to watch her 24/7 to ensure she didn’t try and hurt herself.

I lost a cousin to suicide. we weren't that close but the thought that he had the same condition I did and the possibilities of me doing that to myself and my family were and still are scary realities for me.\n\nI'm not trying to make it about me. forgiving yourself and the other party is the hardest thing with suicide but it's possible and I think it's awesome that you are able to come on here and encourage others while you yourself are in such a tough place.",

        "Post Text": "This sounds like a vague or possibly even dramatic question, but I’m 40, divorced, my ex husband r*ped a 16 year old girl. He was in jail for 9 months pending the trial, and just took a plea deal. Pled guilty to 3 counts of r*pe & sexual misconduct.  So the judge released him with 10 years probation and sex registry. Now my 4 teenage kids and I live in this small town with him. None of us ever want to see him again. I feel like we have no choice but to move, start over somewhere new, so we don’t have to worry about seeing him or him knowing where we live. I don’t have the slightest idea of where to even start. I’ve applied places thru indeed. I don’t have a college degree. I’m overwhelmed, and need some help in this transition. ",

            "Firstly, I’m so sorry you find yourself in this situation.  Every compassion for the problems you and your family find itself in.\n\nAfter saying that… I would recommend finding another smaller town as moving is always stressful, but moving to a very different lifestyle is even more so.  Consider the climate you might prefer, and start looking in areas of the US that match this.  Be mindful of certain states with a reputation to being expensive, and perhaps moving closer to family not in your immediate vicinity.  Having someone around that can help guide you in this process can be a small effort on their part but very relieving to yourself.\n\nI’ve made some major moves in my life, even older than you are now.  There might be a bit of culture shock at times, but there can be a wonder from moving somewhere else and discovering a better life.  I wish you the best in this troubling time.",

You don’t say what you do, but places like hospitals and casinos are always hiring. Same with fast food management. It’s not glamorous but the pay and benefits can be decent.\n\nGood luck.
